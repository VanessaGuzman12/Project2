# Analysis of Mortality causes in Mexico

Using public information from INEGI (National Institute of Statistics and Geography) at indivudual level this project will analyze the mortality causes in Mexico
and the changes overtime.

Moreover, This project will include a geographical analysis.

Mortality causes are coded using the ICD-10

I will use Python for data engineering part and then connect the database with flask

I am planning to present the result in a html page.
